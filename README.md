Files:

Main: The main program. Starts LibraryKNN and MyKNN. Run this to begin.
LibraryKNN: The SKLearn KNN implementation (Requirement F2).
MyKNN: My own KNN implementation (Requirement F3).
F3Model: A txt 'model' of the learning data after using incremental growth.

To start the program, run 'main'.
Main is dependent on LibraryKNN and MyKNN.

The project is dependent on NumPy, SciPy and SKLearn.

As the code is running, you will be required to input:
*The value of K
*The percentage of the dataset to use as testing data
*Whether to use incremental growth in MyKNN.
